# EpicJavaScriptQuiz
i created an html for the first page displayed for the user and a separate html for the questions/highscores page using boilerplate and bootstrap
i started to style css for the questions being displayed
i got the javascript working to where it would display and go to the next question, it doesnt register whether or not the correct selection was made 
the timer doesnt work
the questions/answers show in the console
