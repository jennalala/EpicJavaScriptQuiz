# EpicJavaScriptQuiz
i created an html for the first page displayed for the user and a separate html for the questions/highscores page using boilerplate and bootstrap
i started to style css for the questions being displayed, but didnt finish
i got the javascript working to where it would display and go to the next question 

the questions/answers/selections show in the console,
